#summary The AI system for the agents.

= Introduction =

The brain of the creatures (aka agents) is defined by:
 * Input Sensors
 * Output controls
 * Behaviour modes
 * Genetic algorithm


= Input sensors =

How does an agent perceive the environment?

An agent has a number of input sensors to their disposal:
 * IEye: visual recognition sensor
 * IEye as nose
 * IBumper: collision detection sensor

== IEye ==

{{{
    public interface IEye
    {
        double DistanceToFirstVisible(List<IEntity> sortedEntities, bool useLineOfSight = true);
        double WeightedDistanceToFirstVisible(List<IEntity> sortedEntities, bool useLineOfSight = true);

        bool SeesCreature(ICreature creature);
        bool SeesACreature(List<CreatureTypeEnum> species, IEntity spawnPointToExclude);
        bool SeesACreature(List<CreatureTypeEnum> species);
        bool SeesACreature(CreatureTypeEnum specy);

        bool SeesAnObstacle(EntityTypeEnum entityType);
    }

}}}

The most useful member function for the neural agents is: *WeightedDistanceToFirstVisible* 
It will return the distance to the first visible entity of a specific type in the visual reach of the sensor. The result is weigthed so it can easily be used as input for a neural network.

== Nose ==

By slightly changing the use of an IEye, it can also be used as a nose to retrieve the general direction of the home SpawnPoint.

= by ignoring the line-of-sight rules

{{{ var distance = _nose.WeightedDistanceToFirstVisible(spawnpoint, false); }}}
