#summary The general solution architecture

= Introduction =

The coherence between the different technical components:
 * DawnServer: 
  * the authoritative server
  * the the socket server app
 * User clients:
  * UnityClient
  * MogreClient
  * ConsoleClient
  * MonitoringClient
  * ...
 * AgentMatrix: 
  * the AI controller for a collection of SpawnPoint & Creatures

== Deployment ==

Each node in the overview above can be deployed on a separate machine.

It is advised to place the front-end on a different machine than the Server and AgentMatrixes. 

== Connectivity ==

The nodes communicate using Photon Socket Server technology. 

== Scalability ==

The agent controllers (AgentMatrix nodes) are perfectly scalable. Just deploy more instances on different machines.

The socket server itself is capable of handling a lot more messages then currently required, but is in itself also available in a load balanced mode.

The first expected performance bottleneck is probably the physics engine. This problem will be handled when it is encountered.
