#How the ecosystem works

= Introduction =

The coherence between the different ecosystem entities:
 * family
 * spawn point
 * creature
 * plant
 * resource


= Family =

A family consists of 1 SpawnPoint & all creatures created by this SpawnPoint.

== SpawnPoint ==

 * A SpawnPoint is the origin of the family. It can be compared with a bee hive queen, or an ant family queen.
 * When a SpawnPoint has enough resources, it will create a creature of his family. 
 * All creatures created by a SpawnPoint are identical
 * A SpawnPoint cannot move by itself, but it can be pushed around
 * A SpawnPoint is only interested in specific types of resources. For example, some families are carnivores, other are herbivores. Some can be both, others can be more picky, ...

== Creature ==

 * A creature is the 'worker' of the family. It can be compared with a bee or ant.
 * A creature can move freely in the world
 * A creatures purpose is to gather resources for the SpawnPoint
 * A creature has to defeat other creatures or plants to create resuorces
 * A creature has to deliver these resources back to the SpawnPoint

= Resource =

 * Resources are created by killing creatures and plants
 * 'seed'-resources are generated by plants as part of their reproduction cycle
 * If a resource is left undisturbed, it will turn into a plant

= Plant =

 * A plant is immobile & immovable (cannot be pushed)
 * A plant will periodically generate a 'seed' resource.
 * A plant will extract its necessary resources from the environment itself.
 * If a plant has extracted enough resources from the environment, a 'seed'-resource can be generated
