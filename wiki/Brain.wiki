#summary The brain of the agents.

= Introduction =

The brain consists of a collection of neural networks:
 * a nr of behaviour neural networks
 * a behaviour controller who decides which behaviour is active

The behaviour mode networks are all have an identical topology.
The behaviour controller slightly differences: it has the same amount of input nodes, but 3 specific output nodes, each favouring a different behaviour.

= Neural network =

The neural network used is a 3 layer feedforward network with a large number of reinforcement nodes (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network#Reinforcement_learning).

== Input nodes ==

In the current setup, each agent has 3 eye sensors, 1 nose, 1 bumper, 3 monitors (health, stamina & resources gathered) and 2 random generators.

The eye sensors are configured to look for:
 * Prey: do I see something I can kill?
 * Resources: do I see something I can gather?
 * Walls: do I see a wall?
 * Family: do I see a member of my family?
 * SpawnPoint: do I see my SpawnPoint?

This results into 25 input nodes.
