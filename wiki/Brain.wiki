#summary The brain of the agents.

= Introduction =

The brain consists of a collection of neural networks:
 * a nr of behaviour neural networks
 * a behaviour controller who decides which behaviour is active

The behaviour mode networks are all have an identical topology.
The behaviour controller slightly differences: it has the same amount of input nodes, but 3 specific output nodes, each favouring a different behaviour.

= Neural network =

The neural network used is a 3 layer feedforward network with a large number of reinforcement nodes (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network#Reinforcement_learning).
