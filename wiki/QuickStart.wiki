#summary Quickly setup a release.

= Introduction =

Just get the thing running, without all the hassle of compiling, etc...

= HostFile =




= Release folder =

I included a \Release folder with all files necessary to get up and running.


== DawnServer == 

The first thing to start.

Contains the Photon server app.

Startup using the PhotonControl:
 # Start photon control: \Release\DawnServer\bin_win32\PhotonControl.exe
 # Use the system tray menu to start the DawnServer: \Default\Start as application

== DawnClientConsole ==

Simple console app to monitor the dawnserver.
Start the exe to test if your server is up and running.

If not... check the phtoton logfiles.
Possible causes:
* could not find "dawnserver" (make sure it is in your host file)
* port 5055 or port 9090 are not accessible or used by other apps
* firewall settings, virus checkers, UAC policies, ...

== UnityClient ==

Prebuild 3D client.
Start this after your server. Will give you an overview of first person view of the eco-system.

Keys:
 * use F1/F2 to switch view
 * use numeric keyboard to control camera in overhead view 
  * move: 4, 8, 6, 2
  * zoom: 7, 9
 * use cursor to move (best in first person view)

== DawnAgentMatrix ==

Now it's time to populate the eco-system.

Start as many "AgentMatrix.exe" consoles as your machine can handle.
Each will have 5 spawnpoints to control, and all it's spawned creatures.

The population for the genetic algorithms is always autosaved/loaded. 
= every time you start an AgentMatrix, the creatures will get better





.... enjoy
